# First - Nes

A first attempt at building my own working NES rom prompted by [Kevin Zurawel's] (https://github.com/kzurawel/revconf2017) talk at [RevolutionConf 2017] (https://speakerdeck.com/kzurawel/intro-to-nes-assembly-revolutionconf-2017). I'm always up for a new challenge and what could be more fun and challenging than learnign Assembly for the NES.
